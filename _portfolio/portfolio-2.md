A company receives daily calls from its customers and would like to know how things are going.
The data is split across multiple files, and the company is unable to make good use of it.
Our mission is to develop an ETL project with SSIS that will load data into the new enterprise data warehouse.
As a data engineer team, we will only focus on providing knowledgeable data for the business.
The reports will then be done by another team of data analysts, who will use our data warehouse.

Goals of the project :
• Retrieve data from the many sources
• Design a proper data warehouse
• Apply necessary transformations with SSIS
• Load the data into the data warehouse
