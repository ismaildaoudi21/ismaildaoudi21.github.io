Build an End-To-End Data Engineering Project

<img src='/images/youtube.png'>
Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
Cloud — We can’t process huge amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier

Services we will be using : Amazon S3, AWS IAM, QuickSight, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, AWS Athena

Note : I followed the tutorial of the project done by Darshil Parmar, and here is the link: https://medium.com/@darshilp/end-to-end-data-engineering-project-youtube-analytics-1c7eebf0d31
