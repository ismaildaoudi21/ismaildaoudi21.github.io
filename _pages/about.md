I am a Data Engineer apprentice at EDF, one of the world's largest electric utility companies, where I apply my passion for harnessing the transformative power of data. I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Data Engineering at Data ScienceTech Institute, building on my previous Licence in Informatique at Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord.

As a Data Engineer, I work with various data sources and platforms, using Python and JavaScript to develop and maintain ETL pipelines, APIs, and data integrations. I am skilled in cloud architecture, specifically within the AWS ecosystem, having graduated from the AWS Academy. I also have insights into the DevOps realm, encompassing CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code, enabling me to manage the full spectrum of data engineering processes. Additionally, I perform a technology watch role in my company, staying abreast of tools like Talend, Informatica, Dataiku, Datahub, and Great Expectations, to ensure our data solutions employ industry-leading practices and tools.

I am eager to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for data innovation and to explore opportunities that will allow me to push the boundaries of what's possible in data engineering. I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex data problems and delivering value to the organization and its customers. I am also committed to continuous learning and improvement, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in the data engineering field.
